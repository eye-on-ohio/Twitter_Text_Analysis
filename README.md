# Twitter_Text_Analysis
This code is for a story that [Eye on Ohio](EyeonOhio.com) did looking at online harrassment that journalists and others [face.](https://eyeonohio.com/sidebar-shut-your-mouth-journalists-face-a-rising-tide-of-online-harassment/) 

This isn't a scientific study; nor is it meant to be. This is just a look at language posted online using publicly available text mining tools and sentiment analysis.

You can adapt this code for your own use with a share-share alike license. (In other words, please use it, but please cite us.)
